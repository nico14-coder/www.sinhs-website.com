    </font>  
    <font color="white" class="outlined-content">
        Technical Vocational Livelihood (TVL) refers to a structured educational system that provides specialized training and knowledge for specific trades, occupations, or careers. It focuses on developing practical skills and competencies through a combination of theoretical instruction and hands-on training. TVE aims to prepare students for direct entry into the workforce by equipping them with the technical expertise necessary for performing specialized tasks in various industries, such as engineering, healthcare, IT, construction, and manufacturing.

        In educational settings, TVE can be offered at secondary or post-secondary levels and is often delivered through vocational schools, technical colleges, or training centers. The curriculum typically integrates both classroom-based learning and practical experience, ensuring students acquire the skills and qualifications necessary to excel in their chosen professions.

        The primary objective of TVE is to bridge the gap between formal education and the labor market, providing students with the ability to meet the demands of employers in specific fields. It is considered an alternative or complementary route to academic education, focusing more on preparing individuals for careers that require specialized knowledge and technical proficiency.
